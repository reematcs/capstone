# Problem Statement
Sometimes old comic books are lost, or not in a well-preserved state. If one or more pages are provided to a model, can it provide some clues to a person as to who the penciler of the comic is likely to be?

# Executive Summary

Using CNN, one can classify comic book pages into different pencilers with a 60% validation accuracy rating.

A penciler, in collaboration with a writer, does first rendering of stories to visual art-form (historically done on paper with pencil, hence the term). 
These days people still use paper and pencil then Photoshop, or many other forms/iterations.
